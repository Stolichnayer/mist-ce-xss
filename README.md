# CVE-2025-MIST-XSS  
## Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Tag Field

## 📜 Description
Mist CE v4.7.1 contains a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability within its tag functionality. Mist resources, including **Machines, Volumes, Zones, Images, Keys, and Scripts**, support user-defined tags in key-value format. The vulnerability resides in the **value field** of these tags, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected and persistently stored. When a user views the resource listing page, the injected script is executed due to the application’s failure to properly sanitize user input.

## 📌 Affected Version
- **Mist CE v4.7.1** (latest release)
- Other versions may also be affected but have not been tested.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is intended for **educational and ethical research purposes only**.
Unauthorized testing on systems without explicit permission is illegal.
Use responsibly and only on systems you own or have permission to test.

## 💻 Exploit Details

### 🔹 **Stored XSS Exploitation**
The injected script remains stored within the Mist interface and is triggered when an authenticated user navigates to the resource listing page. This can lead to:
- **Automatic JavaScript execution in the victim’s browser**
- **Session hijacking and user impersonation**
- **Potential privilege escalation and persistent access**

## 🛠️ Steps to Reproduce

### 1️⃣ Insert Malicious Payload into a Tag
For example, add the following payload as a **tag value** within a Mist resource:
```html
<iframe src="javascript:alert('Clouds')"></iframe>
```

### 2️⃣ Save Tag
- Click the **Save** button to store the tag.
- The malicious payload is now stored within the Mist resource.
